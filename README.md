## Skills

**Problem Solving**

I have always been a very quick learner. At makers, the most useful skill I have learned is how to learn and adapt.

-	Situation - In our final project at makers we were making an e-commerce website called Bazaar. Towards the end of our project, the feature to list an item through our website wasn't working properly and we were unsure if would be able to implement it with in the time.
-	Task - The ability to display products was a big part of our app, and without it, it appeared empty and unappealing.
-	Action - I came up with the idea to populate our app with pictures and descriptions from internet and because our server side was working fine we could use postman to submit data as Json.
-	Result - We were able to create a professional and attractive app, while still meeting the deadline


**Debugging**

During my time at Makers, I was always eager to examine my peers code and assist them in any way I could. That helped me improve my debugging skills to the point where I was frequently sought out by my peers. Following a thorough approach to debugging, I was generally able to break down other people's code and discover where the fault could be.

-	Situation - In week 7, we were assigned to a small group of three people and given the assignment of creating a single-page application that could be used to write down notes and display them shortened and expanded when clicked on. The project was running smoothly until we encountered an issue while incorporating an emoji API.
-	Task - I was given the task to resolve the issue within the remaining time of the project.
-	Action - I applied a methodical approach using console logs extensively and quickly realized that we were creating an HTML line element in a call back function every time we were retrieving full note after using the emoji API. The problem was that we were using async-await after the implementation of the API and the line element was not available straight away to be appended into a div.
-	Result - By using a thorough approach I was quickly able to narrow down the issue and solve it by creating the div within the call back function. And being able to solve that within an hour we were able to focus on the styling and finishing the project in time.
